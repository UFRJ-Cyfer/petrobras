  doi = {10.1016/j.engfailanal.2009.02.003},
  abstract = {In an efficient and effective pipe integrity management programme, maintenance engineers often use the risk-based inspection (RBI) and maintenance strategy. Unfortunately, the calculation of risk is a daunting task because in order to calculate the risk of failure, a maintenance engineer needs to predict the rate of growth of a defect, the effect of the defect on the integrity of the structure and the consequence of failure. Unfortunately precise calculation for either of these parts is quite difficult. Fuzzy logic is a mathematical tool suitable for handling imprecise information in the real world. The benefit of this approach lies in its ability to include personal experiences along with acceptable deterministic models in the calculation. The structure of the model also allows easy calibration of the model to suit a particular plant condition. This approach can thus help to reduce the dependence upon the precise data, allow modelling even when a phenomenon is incompletely understood, and reduce the difficulties arising due to the complex computation required by more traditional methods. This paper presents a proposed methodology, based on fuzzy logic framework, for the establishment of an RBI programme for pipes. The paper also presents in detail a section of the methodology that can be used for calculating the estimated rate of CO2 corrosion in carbon steel pipes. In this technique the plant operating parameters (temperature, gas and liquid flow rates, total pressure, CO2 partial pressure and pH) are taken as fuzzy variables and used to calculate the Predicted Rate of Corrosion. The inspected rate of corrosion and the efficiency of inspection are also considered as fuzzy variables and are used to calculate Trust in Inspection Results and Trust in Predicted Results. By combining all the modules an estimated rate of corrosion is calculated. This estimated rate of corrosion can then be used for developing the risk-based inspection programme.},

  abstract = {Periodic Internal Inspection Method often results in under-inspection or over-inspection for large-scale crude oil tank. Therefore, how to determine reasonable internal inspection interval (INTII) has great significance on balancing the safe operation requirement and inspection cost for crude oil tanks. Here, RBI (risk-based inspection) technology is used to quantitatively assess the risk of crude oil tanks in an oil depot in China. The risk comparison between tank shell and bottom shows that the risk of tank depends on the risk of tank bottom. The prediction procedure of INTII for crude oil tanks is also presented. The INTII predicted by RBI method is gradually extended with the increasing of the acceptable risk level. The method to determine the acceptable risk of crude oil tanks is proposed, by which 3.54E+04 are taken as the acceptable risk of the oil depot. The safety factor of 0.8 is proposed to determine the final INTIIs for 18 crude oil tanks. The INTII requirement in China code SY/T 5921, 5\textendash{}7 years, is very conservative and lower than predicted service life of tanks. The INTIIs predicted by Gumbel method are smaller than by RBI method for tanks with short INTII. Therefore, this paper recommends RBI method to predict the INTII for crude oil tanks.},

Located acoustic emission events were filtered for a narrow band containing the fatigue crack, and separated for different regions of the applied load range. The test results indicate that acoustic emission count rates, for small percentages of the applied load range close to the peak load, show reasonable correlation with crack propagation rates. Based on these correlations it may be possible to predict the remaining service life of fatigue damaged structures from the results of short term acoustic emission monitoring.},

Emissions occurring near the peak load of the fatigue cycle were separated from those occurring near the minimum load by gating techniques. The peak load emissions were attributed to both crack extension and to deformation and fracture events occurring within the crack tip plastic zone, and these emissions have been correlated with the energy released during crack growth. The effect of material and testing variables on these emissions was also examined. The minimum load emissions were attributed to crack closure processes; they could be important in crack closure studies, and in detecting fatigue cracks in materials ``quiet'' at peak load. Single overloads resulted in fatigue crack growth retardation, accompanied by a sharp fall in peak and minimum load acoustic emission. This could be useful for the practical application of acoustic emission monitoring to fatigue situations.},

Based on results of the proof, a four-layered network is constructed and is found to give any N input-target relations with a negligibly small error using only (N/2)+3 hidden units.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

  abstract = {This article reports an investigation which was a part of a wider study of defect sizing techniques. The authors have examined the method of crack depth determination using scattered ultrasound developed by B\"ottcher et al with special reference to contract probe studies with normal grade structural steels. They conclude that the use of amplitude of the scattered signal as a measure of crack depth, as proposed, suffers from a number of serious drawbacks in these contexts. However, the alternative of using the change of time delay between the transmitted and the first received signal has been investigated here and appears to provide a very attractive alternative.},

  abstract = {The ultrasonic time of flight diffraction technique (TOFD) is a routine method for defect detection and sizing performance in engineering structures. The first book by the authors, published in 1989, aimed to give the non-destructive testing engineer comprehensive information on the theoretical background, practicl implementation and performance of the technique. The method is now widely used and is a European as well as a British Standard. This second edition includes new material on the theoretical basis, experimental demonstration of capability and engineering applications of TOFD. The book also includes a chapter on standards, citing work on British and European standards.},
